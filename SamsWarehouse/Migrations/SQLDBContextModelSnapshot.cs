Bananas should be plump, firm, and brightly colored.\n\n\nStore bananas at room temperature, where they will continue to ripen. If you refrigerate your bananas, they will stop ripening, but this will also make the skins go black. The fruit is still okay to eat, but will not be the best quality.\n\n\nAustralian Red Tip Bananas are grown in Far North Queensland, near Innisfail.\n\n\nBananas contain potassium for heathy muscle function, and are high in energy-supprting vitamin B6* \n\n*Based on one large cavendish banana, or 2 medium lady finger bananas (150g), as part of a healthy balanced diet",
